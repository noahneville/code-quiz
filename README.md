# code-quiz
For this project, I used JavaScript, HTML and the Bootstrap CSS API to make a code quiz that runs a timer and scores based on correct answers and time remaining.

I had a lot of difficulty getting the timer to work and figuring out how to use an object to store questions and answers and write them to the page. I spent too much time on those problems and ultimately ran out of time on the project. I did not have time to implement a leaderboard or any css styling to make the page look good. This is still a work in progress, and I'll be working on it more in the coming days to get everything working correctly and then resubmit it because I'm very unhappy with myself and my work here.
